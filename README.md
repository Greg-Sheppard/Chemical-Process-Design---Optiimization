# Chemical Process Design & Optimization

Traveling Salesman Problem - Addresses both brute force and simulated annealing solutions to the classic optimization problem by the same name

Maximum Energy Recovery Analysis - Automates a common process within chemical engineering that involves determining the amount of energy that can be saved by fully integrating a process design rather than externally heating/cooling given components of the process.
